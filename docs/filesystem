Longer term goal: four-tiered filesystem
* Unmodifiable base (also in initramfs along with config)
  * This is transactionally updated by generating a new initramfs
* Package-manager controlled layer (like today's /usr)
* Sysadmin-modification layer (like other distros' /usr/local)
* User-controlled layer (like ~/.config and ~/.local)

Sysadmin is not root (can be, but discouraged)
* User rights managed by policies
* Daemon rights managed by capabilities
* No SUID or CAP_*_ADMIN utilities - talk to management daemons
* No dbus either, use something more like OpenWRT
