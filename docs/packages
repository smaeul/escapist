Groups
~~~~~~
Skel: The minimum set of packages required to qualify as an Escapist Linux installation. Any system without all of base installed cannot be supported. This includes
everything needed to boot to a (usable) shell, mount filesystems, and install packages.
Devel: The set of tools required to compile a basic C/C++ project
Net: A selection of tools that will get most people's network running and allow for basic diagnostics
Base: The recommended minimum level of installation.

Implementations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Standard utilities with multiple implementations will be named in the format <provider>-<tool> (gnu-grep, toybox-sed, openbsd-netcat), and will provide <tool>.
Unless applications require specific features, they should depend on <tool> only, especially for standardized utilities.
